          A Python programmer and small business consultant from Birmingham, AL. After earning a degree in Chemical Engineering from Louisiana State University, I ventured beyond traditional engineering roles, aligning my career with my passion for technology and innovation. My journey has taken me from a refining engineer to embracing startup culture with Venture for America and leading strategic operations at a health tech startup and a research institute. I am particularly passionate about biological analytics and digital biology, aiming to merge my technical expertise with advancements in these fields.
